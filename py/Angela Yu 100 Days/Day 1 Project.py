#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("Welcome to the band name generator!")
#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
City_Origin = input("What city did you grow up in?\n")
#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
Name_Pet = input("What is the name of a pet?\n")
#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
Band_Name = City_Origin + " " + Name_Pet
print("Your band name could be " + Band_Name)
#5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line:
  # add \n to end of input strings
